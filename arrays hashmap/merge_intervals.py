# Problem Statement: Given an array of intervals,
# merge all the overlapping intervals and return an array of non-overlapping intervals.

# Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
# Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
# Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].


class Solution:
    def merge(self, intervals: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        merged = []
        for interval in intervals:
            if not merged or merged[-1][1] < interval[0]:
                merged.append(interval)
            else:
                merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])
        return merged
